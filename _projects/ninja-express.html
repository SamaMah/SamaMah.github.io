    Ninja Express is a fun animated tv-show produced by Creative Conspiracy, a production company based in Gent. <br>
    More information can be found on the <a href="http://www.cc.be/portfolio/three-little-ninjas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Conspiracy Website</a>. <br>
    <br>
    I've worked as a Fusion compositor on this project. <br>
    My role was episode lead, creating templates and establishing the look of each episode, that would then be picked up by the rest of the team.
